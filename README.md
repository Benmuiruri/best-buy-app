# Best Buy 

### Make shopping decisions with confidence

Making purchase decisions while shopping can be overwhelming and time-consuming, with so many options and prices to choose from. That's why I created **Best Buy App** to make it easier for you to determine which product offers the most value and make smart shopping decisions.

### General Overview

With Best Buy App, you can compare the prices of different sizes of the same product and see which one offers the most value based on weight and cost. Simply enter the price and weight of the small and large sizes, and the app do the rest. It will even tell you if it's worth spending more money on the larger item, or if you're better off sticking with the smaller size.
